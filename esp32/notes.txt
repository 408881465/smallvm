These boot and partition files are from Arduino ESP32 development system. The same files files are also used by PlatformIO. The partitions.bin is the default.bin from the partitions folder in the ESP32 package.

Address		File
0x1000		bootloader_dio_80m.bin
0x8000		partitions.bin
0xE000		boot_app0.bin

In theory, an ESP32 module with a different Flash configuration might require different files, but so far this set of files works for  all the boards MicroBlocks currently supports (the ESP32 dev board, ED1, and m5stack).
